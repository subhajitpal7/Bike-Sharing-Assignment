# Bike Sharing Assignment(MLR)
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## General Information
- Creation of model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
- It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
- They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- The demand for bike will increase in 2019
- Highest deman is in the month of Sept
- Temperature plays very important role in bikesharing
- R2 score value for predictions on test data (0.769) and R2 score value of train data(0.785). Those two R-Squared values not much differ from each other then is difference of 2-3%, hence we can see our model is performing good even on unseen data (test data)
